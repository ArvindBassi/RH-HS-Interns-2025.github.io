<h3>About Me:</h3>

<h4>School:</h4>

<p>
 As of right now, I currently attend Boston Latin Academy. For sports I do both indoor and outdoor track & field, along with football. I have met many people at BLA and while the school is not perfect,
 I enjoy the experience and wish to become more invovled in the community.

<h5>Interests:</h5>




<p>I have many interests that I'm invested in. The largest interest of mine right now is music, as to me it
 serves as a way for me to focus on work and also complement how I feel in a certain moment. Other casual interests of mine are basketball, football, gaming, and drawing.
