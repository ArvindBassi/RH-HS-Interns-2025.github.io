  <h1>Hello everyone!</h1>
    <h2> Here is some things about me </h2>
Hi! My name is Bao, and I’m a rising junior at Boston Latin School. I’m passionate about both academics and staying active, and I try to strike a good balance between the two in my everyday life. I love playing sports, especially soccer and volleyball, which not only keep me physically fit but also help me build strong teamwork and leadership skills. Whether it's chasing a ball down the field or diving for a save on the volleyball court, I find joy As I move into my junior year, I’m excited to keep exploring new challenges, both in the classroom and beyond, while continuing to grow as a student, teammate, and individual. I want to continue learning new things and connecting to fellow classmates! When I’m not studying or playing sports, you can probably find me enjoying a refreshing matcha drink or spending time with my cat, Milo. He’s playful, curious, and always keeps things interesting around the house. I’ve also found that taking quiet moments with Milo or sipping matcha helps me recharge and stay grounded amidst a busy school schedule. </body>
