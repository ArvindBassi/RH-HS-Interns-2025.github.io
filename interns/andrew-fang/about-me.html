  <h1>An Introduction to Myself</h1>
    <ul>
    <li>Location: Westford, Massachussets</li>
    <li>Occupation: Rising Senior at Westford Academy</li>
    <li>I am the youngest of three siblings, I have two older sisters who are 19 and 24</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>My career interests</h1>
    <p>My interests lies in VLSI design, specifically ARM-based processing. I wish to become a leading inovator in ARM-based processing
    and implement ARM architecture in more extensive workloads such as server machines. I find the power efficiency of ARM architecture 
    fascinating, and would wish to implement it in more workloads to support a more environmentally conscious future.</p>
  <h1>What brings me here:</h1>
    <p>I want to learn more about the software dominated fields in the tech industry and overall to see the technology industry from 
        a different perspective. I have little to no experience with software developemnt, and this internship has helped educate me about
        the software dominated perspective of the tech industry.
