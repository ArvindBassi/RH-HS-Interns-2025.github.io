        <h2 class="black-text">Day 3: What are some of the differences you've noticed between a school environment and a professional work environment?
 </h2>
        <p class="personalnarr" >Some major differences I've found between a school environment and a professional work environment is the difference in freedom, responsibility, and ability to do things. I think school is great to increase your knowledge, but I think that a professional work environment helps a ton with experience of the real world, and applications of what we've learned in school in the real world. School environments are more learning oriented, and you learn a ton in professional work environments, but you also apply that in the real world.

        <h2 class="black-text">Day 4: What is a topic that you found interesting this week? How do you plan to seek additional information and learn more about that topic? 
</h2>
        <p class="personalnarr" >A topic I found very interesting this week was AI and how it functions, especially with respect to OpenShift. I found it especially interesting that Delta Airlines is a client of OpenShift, and uses it in their software. I think the idea to create an AI built operating system is a fantastic idea and plan, especially to stay competitive in the market. I plan to do a bit more research on OpenShift, as well as speak to more people who work relatively close to the topic, and hopefully get a pretty good understanding of its functionality and how Red Hat created it, and how companies use it. I think it's a great tool and an awesome idea. Another thing I found very interesting this week was the simulation between the UX designer, the Product Manager, and the Engineering Manager. Being given an issue, and seeing how the three sectors operate in order to resolve the conflict was very interesting to me. Thinking of all of the possible issues the consumer is having, thinking of what to ask, and then what to implement to fix that issue, is a lot harder than it might seem.

        <h2 class="black-text">Day 6: How is the internship meeting or not meeting your expectations/objectives and why? Do you have control of this? Explain.
</h2>
        <p class="personalnarr" >The internship is definitely meeting my expectations and objectives, as I've been able to learn a great deal of how an industry leader functions in the market, and how people individually find their passions and what they want to do in their lives. The mix of that and the ability to talk to other interns and people and ask them questions is extremely helpful and nice, and it’s giving me exposure I didn’t think I would have. Especially in high school. My objectives are essentially to talk to as many people as I can and gain their insights on the market and their fields, and gain more technical and non-technical knowledge. So far, everything has been great.

        <h2 class="black-text">Day 8: How has this experience affected or changed your career/college plans?
</h2>
        <p class="personalnarr" >This experience has definitely enhanced and acted as a motivator in terms of my college plans. Its made me realize what sectors I'm interested in, and has provided valuable insights and information to those sectors. I’ve talked with people, heard their stories from the beginning of college to now, and after speaking to them, I actually feel a bit less stressed. One commonality I’ve found with almost every person I’ve spoken to here at Red Hat, is they all said you don’t always immediately know what you’re gonna want to do. The job market and innovation is everchanging, and the most important skill to help you thrive in it, is to change with it. This experience has enhanced and encouraged my desire for a college degree, and a focus on my future.
