  <h1>Hi!</h1>

  <p>My name is Ella Callahan and I am a current high school intern at Red Hat. Outside of school, I love to play soccer and basketball while also keeping myself busy with two part-time jobs at ice cream shops. I enjoy volunteering at the local food pantry and farm co-op and I dedicate my time to various clubs including DECA and Debate club as well. I am enthusiastic when it comes to AI and furthering my knowledge in this department and finding nnew ways to interact with it. One of my greatest strengths is my ability to collaborate and listen to others and incorporate that information into my own work and in the workplace. </p>
