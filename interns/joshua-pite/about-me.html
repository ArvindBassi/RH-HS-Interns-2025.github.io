                        <p>I'm entering my senior year in highschool and im passionate in mechanical engineering, Robotics, and Architechture. I am currently completing my RED HAT highschool internship in Boston. </p>
                        <p>During my internship at Red Hat, I've been working on various projects that have expanded my understanding of enterprise software development, collaboration, and the importance of community-driven innovation.</p>
                        <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me playing ice hockey, designing clothes, or listening to music.</p>

                            <h4> Question:</h4> 
                            <p>What is one new skill or piece of knowledge you've gained this week? How do you see yourself applying this in the future?</p>
                            <h4>Answer:</h4> 
                            <p>One new skill I have learned during my time at Red Hat is from the Chief Product Officer, Ashesh Badani, and he said to really pay attention to the ratio of how much you speak versus how much you listen and take in. I have been trying to pay more attention to this because I found him very well spoken and I believe that if I add that to my skills then I will be better spoken which will help me in the future with getting jobs or other things along those lines.</p>

                            <h4> Question:</h4> 
                            <p>What are your main takeaways from this first half of your internship and how do you plan to carry those lessons into your second week?  </p>
                            <h4>Answer:</h4> 
                            <p>Some of my main takeaways from this first half of my internship are that you should really be attentive and take notes because the amount of information and important people that we have spoken to is insane and there is just so much to take away and actually digest and learn from. I plan on applying this even more next week by continuing to take notes and I'm going to ask even more questions and be more curious in the future. There are many impactful and intelligent people at RedHat and  having the opportunity to talk to a lot of them is very special so I really want to take the most out of it.</p>

                            <p>How is the internship meeting or not meeting your expectations/objectives and why? Do you have control of this? Explain.</p>
                            <h4>Answer:</h4> 
                            <p>This internship has definitely exceeded my expectations all around because before coming here I didn't know how it would be and how the facility was or anything. But it has been an amazing experience and opportunity for me because I have learned so much already and it's very interesting to learn everyone's role and learn from the best. I definitely do have control over how this internship goes for me because at the end of the day I'm the one whose learning so it's in my control to ask questions and really interact with other people to understand and learn. That's something I really like because I feel like it's really independent.</p>

                            <p>If you could give advice to a student starting this internship next year, what would it be?</p>
                            <h4>Answer:</h4> 
                            <p>Really take this as an opportunity to learn in every single little moment because there are so many ways you can expand your knowledge and everyone here has a mind of their own and one goal which is to help the company be successful so really even if you're not interested in a finance lesson, there might be some key information that you will need to be aware of in the future so really be engaged, ask questions and make the most out of the experience.</p>
